## Description of reproduction

- `deep_q_learning.ipynb`
  
  The deep Q-learning implementation run with original parameters.
  
- `SARSA.ipynb`
  
  The deep SARSA implementation run with the original parameters.
  
- `SARSA-parameter-tuning.ipynb`
  
  The deep SARSA implementation run with beta = [0.00005, 0.0005, 0.005, 0.05] and gamma = [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.45, 0.35].
  
- `deep-q-learning_rmsprop.ipynb`
  
  The deep Q-learning implementation run with the original parameters, changed reward administration, RMSprop, and both changed rewards and RMSprop.
  
- `deep-q-learning-parameter-tuning.ipynb`
  
  The deep Q-learning implementation run with beta = [0.00005, 0.0005, 0.005, 0.05] and gamma = [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.45, 0.35].
